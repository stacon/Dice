# Dice
A simple program that emulates dice rolls with custom number of dimensions and times rolled. Like rolling 5d20 but with a function.

# Usage
```
Dice.rollD(20) // returns a number between 1 - 20 like a d20 roll would.
Dice.rollD(12, 5) // returns a number between 5 - 60 like 5 d12s roll would.
```
